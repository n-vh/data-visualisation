# Data Visualisation

- Type of challenge: **consolidation**
- Team challenge: **solo**

## Objectives

This consolidation challenge will help you assess your ability to solve a problem inspired from real-life situations using your new JavaScript muscles involving the following know-hows :

- DOM manipulation.
- FETCH request.
- Using third-party libraries.
- Problem-solving: design a logical solution to implement the expected result.
- Debugging using the console.
- Understand the notion of "separation of concerns".

## How will we do this?

1. Use [chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/).
2. Attack the problem by looking for a good logical path. Break it down into **small problems**, into **progressive** steps. Commit as you move forward. First the DOM, access the right place, then retrieve the data, then generate the graph.
3. A method of thinking: _Reverse-engineering_ of your objective: start at the end and go up the thread of dependencies to the starting point. It gives something like this:

## Constraints

- You can't edit the HTML file.
- You have the choice of the type of graphics. Considers the most relevant based on the data and what story they can "tell".
